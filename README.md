## TL;DR

Stop journaling by vibes. This workbook enforces a schema, computes expectancy and edge, and benchmarks strategies across time and market regimes.

Know your stance now: dynamic link to Equity, Long/Short Market Value, Gross/Net/Gearing (leverage) so you always know if you’re net long/short, and whether you’re long or short options premium.

Decide size rationally: built‑in Kelly criterion using empirical win rate and payoff ratio (Avg Win/|Avg Loss|) to estimate fraction of equity to risk per trade.


## Motivation

Most trade journals collect anecdotes. This one collects evidence. By structuring inputs and automating the calculations, it replaces confirmation bias with testable metrics:

Which strategies actually work for me?

Do I over‑hold losers or cut winners early?

Where does my P&L really come from—ticker, setup, tenor, or direction?
